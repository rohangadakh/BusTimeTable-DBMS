Bus Timetable Management System
1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
The Bus Timetable Management System is a web-based application that helps users manage and maintain bus timetables. It allows for adding, deleting, and displaying bus details like the bus name, destination, arrival time, and departure time. The information is stored in a database and dynamically updated via a user-friendly interface.

1.2 Aim/Motivation
The aim is to develop an efficient web-based system for managing bus timetables using PHP, MySQL, and Tailwind CSS. The motivation is to provide a modern, accessible tool to simplify timetable management for transportation services.

1.3 Objective
Store bus timetable data in a structured database.
Provide a responsive user interface for easy bus data management.
Enable adding, viewing, updating, and deleting bus records.

2. Literature Survey
Many transportation systems rely on either manual methods or basic desktop applications for managing timetables. Web-based applications, however, provide real-time access and flexibility. Technologies like MySQL and PHP are commonly used due to their reliability and ease of integration.

Related Systems
Google Transit: Primarily for larger systems.
OpenTripPlanner: An open-source transport routing and scheduling project.
Our project focuses on smaller-scale systems, providing ease of access and simple data management.

3. Problem Statement
Managing bus timetables manually can lead to errors and delays. Traditional systems lack:

Accessibility: Not available via the web.
Data persistence: Data may be lost or corrupted.
Modern UI: Outdated interfaces make them harder to use.
This project addresses these issues by creating a web-based timetable system that ensures accessibility, persistent data storage, and an intuitive user interface.

4. Hardware & Software Requirements Specification
4.1 Hardware Requirements
Client-side: PC or mobile device with a browser.
Server-side:
Processor: 2 GHz dual-core CPU or better.
RAM: 4 GB or more.
Storage: 20 GB minimum.
4.2 Software Requirements
Server-side software:
MySQL: Database management.
PHP: Backend logic.
Apache/Nginx: Web server.
Client-side:
Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
Development tools:
PHPMyAdmin: MySQL management.
VS Code/Sublime Text: For writing code.
5. System Design
5.1 Project Block Diagram
The system has three main components:

Frontend: User interacts with the system via forms built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.
Backend: PHP processes the data, handling CRUD operations.
Database: MySQL stores bus details.
Database Schema:

CREATE TABLE timetable (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    bus_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    arrival_time TIME NOT NULL,
    departure_time TIME NOT NULL
);
5.2 GUI of Working System
The interface is built using Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern design. Key features:

Form: Allows users to add a new bus with its name, destination, arrival, and departure times.
Table: Displays all buses in a timetable format.
Footer: Links to the projectâ€™s GitHub profile.
Example:

| Bus Name | Destination | Arrival Time | Departure Time | Actions |
--------------------------------------------------------------------
| Bus 101  | City Center | 10:00 AM     | 10:15 AM       | Delete  |
6. Conclusion
The Bus Timetable Management System provides a user-friendly, web-based solution for managing bus schedules. It offers real-time data management with persistent storage using MySQL. The interface, built with Tailwind CSS, ensures a modern and responsive experience.

The system can easily be expanded and adapted for different users, from small transport companies to larger organizations.
